                 When I see your smile <br>
                Tears run down my face I can't replace <br>
                And now that I'm strong I have figured out <br>
                How this world turns cold and it breaks through my soul <br>
                And I know I'll find deep inside me I can be the one <br>
                 <br>
                I will never let you fall (let you fall)  <br>
                I'll stand up with you forever <br>
                I'll be there for you through it all (through it all) <br>
                Even if saving you sends me to heaven <br>
                 <br>
                It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. <br>
                Seasons are changing <br>
                And waves are crashing <br>
                And stars are falling all for us <br>
                Days grow longer and nights grow shorter <br>
                I can show you I'll be the one <br>
                 <br>
                I will never let you fall (let you fall) <br>
                I'll stand up with you forever <br>
                I'll be there for you through it all (through it all) <br>
                Even if saving you sends me to heaven <br>
                 <br>
                'Cause you're my, you're my, my, my true love, my whole heart <br>
                Please don't throw that away <br>
                'Cause I'm here for you <br>
                Please don't walk away and <br>
                Please tell me you'll stay, whoa, stay, whoa <br>
                 <br>
                Use me as you will <br>
                Pull my strings just for a thrill <br>
                And I know I'll be okay <br>
                Though my skies are turning gray <br>
                 <br>
                I will never let you fall <br>
                I'll stand up with you forever <br>
                I'll be there for you through it all <br>
                Even if saving you sends me to heaven <br>
                to fade.
